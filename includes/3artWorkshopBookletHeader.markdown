# About this document

This document is available in different formats for students who may have accessibility requirements. See [Versions](#versions). The system is still being piloted and I'd be interested in your [feedback](mailto:ian.hocking@canterbury.ac.uk).

## Tasks and Your Lab Journal

Use this booklet in conjunction with your own *Lab Journal*, where you will record your workings, thoughts, and other comments related to the exercises. Your Lab Journal can take any form, but a Word document might be best; you can copy and paste output from Tlearn alongside your notes.

(If you're looking at a non-standard, accessible version of this document, some of the formatting below will be simplified.)

<div latex="true" class="task" id="Task"> 

- When I ask you to complete a task, like calculate a mean, it will be formatted like this.

</div>

<div latex="true" class="journal" id="Journal">

- This is what a Lab Journal reminder looks like. I'll use these when asking you to make a note.

</div>

## Other Aspects of this Booklet

<div latex="true" class="highlight" id="Remember">

- This formatting will be used to highlight something important.

</div>

<div latex="true" class="answer" id="Answer"> 

Here I'll provide answers to questions. Note that this version of the document won't be available until after your workshop.

## Downloading Tlearn

You can download Tlearn for Windows, Mac and Unix here: [Innate](http://crl.ucsd.edu/innate/tlearn.html).

Remember that you’re just setting out with Tlearn, so this booklet might take you some time to get through. However, it’s important that you work through it methodically and try to understand as much as possible as you go along.

## Answers

Sometimes, when there is an instructor version of an exercise booklet, you'll be provided with a second version of this document, containing answers, a few days after your seminar.
