You should attend all sessions. A register is collected
at the beginning of each. If you are unavoidably absent
from a session, please [email

To find out more, go to the Psychology General Blackboard > Essential info > extenuating circumstances for the documents you need to fill in. The university also maintains a page with general [extenuating circumstances information](http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/extenuating-circumstances).]
