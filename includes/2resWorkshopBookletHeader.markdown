# About this document

This document is available in different formats for students who may have accessibility requirements. See [Versions](#versions). The system is still being piloted and I'd be interested in your [feedback](mailto:ian.hocking@canterbury.ac.uk).

## Tasks and Your Research Journal

Use this booklet in conjunction with your own *Research Journal*, where you will record your workings, thoughts, and other comments related to the exercises. Your Research Journal can take any form, but a Word document might be best; you can copy and paste output from SPSS alongside your notes.

(If you're looking at a non-standard, accessible version of this document, some of the formatting below will be simplified.)

<task>

- When I ask you to complete a task, like calculate a mean, it will be formatted like this.

</task>

<journal>

- This is what a Research Journal reminder looks like. I'll use these when asking you to make a note.

</journal>

## Other Aspects of this Booklet

<highlight>

- This formatting will be used to highlight something important.

## Mathematics and Statistics Help

If you're not confident in your algebra, which is important for dealing with equations, try this [Introduction to Algebra](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction.html).

## Answers

You'll be provided with a second version of this document, containing answers, a few days after your seminar. I'll include SPSS Syntax and possibly SPSS Data files to help you reproduce the correct answers quickly. 

When you use menus and dialogue boxes within SPSS to do analyses, SPSS is actually building up a complex command in its native language, syntax, and then running this command. It is feasible for you to access these complex commands yourself. In any dialogue box, the *paste* button will produce the appropriate syntax to do a particular analysis. You can save this syntax as text and run it again at a later date to get the same output. If you want to repeat an analysis quickly, changing bits like variables or type of test, editing syntax is often the best way.

Paste the syntax into an *SPSS syntax window* using *File* > *New* > *Syntax*. Highlight the syntax and click the green arrow to make SPSS run the syntax, producing the appropriate output.

It would be a good idea to get used to SPSS Syntax, though I'm not expecting you to use it instead of the graphical, 'point and click' interface.
