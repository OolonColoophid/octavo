All students now have access to a ‘draft’ TurnItIn submission on Psychology General > TURNITIN - DRAFTS. You can use this to get an idea of your ‘originality index’ (i.e. the overlap between your work and previously published work) before having to submit a final assignment. Remember, however, that the Psychology General submission is just for drafts; you need to submit your assignment via the module Blackboard, as usual.
